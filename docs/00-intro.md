# Introduction

Welcome to the MERN + Vite Template Repository!

This repo is designed to help you kickstart your full-stack apps quickly. As a MERN stack developer using Vite, I found myself repeating a lot of setup steps across projects â€” so I built this as both a template and a knowledge hub.

## ðŸ”¥ What's Inside:

- Clean folder structure
- Ready-to-use React + Express boilerplate
- Integration examples (React Router, Axios, Firebase, MongoDB, etc.)
- Reusable UI components
- Notes and guides in Markdown format

> Perfect for beginners or anyone who wants to stay organized and build faster.
